    "Survey respondents were promised that any personal information gathered, namely their email address, would not be shared in any publicly visible platform. To keep this promise and to follow data ethics to tbe best of my ability, email addresses in the original respondent CSV file obtained from the Google Form survey were replaced in my very first step of cleaning with an identifying value for the family instead of the email. This was then saved as a new CSV file that will be safe to be posted on GitHub and Tableau and that \"safe\" file will be used for the remainder of this project. The original CSV with email addresses was deleted  from the repo immediately following cleaning. The code used to do that is shown but hashed out to protect the privacy of all respondents. "

To simplify that cat's coat color into just one column, I need to first replace null values with an empty string, then move any values left in the other_color column to the color column, replacing anything in the color column (this would have shown up as just the string \"other\") with the value from the other_color column IF there isn't an empty string in the other_color column. Along the way I'll check to see what strings are in the other_color column, and then to check to see if this worked I'll print the first 50 rows of the DataFrame to get a good representation of how the values transferred."
